## Toggle Buttons Example

This is an example of how to use toggle buttons in your mobile app. Toggle buttons are a type of button that can be switched on or off, providing a binary choice for the user.

To use toggle buttons in your app, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary dependencies:
    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    ```

2. Create a list of boolean values to represent the state of each toggle button:
    ```dart
    List<bool> toggleValues = [false, false, false];
    ```

3. Build the toggle buttons using the `ToggleButtons` widget:
    ```dart
    ToggleButtons(
      children: [
         Icon(Icons.favorite),
         Icon(Icons.star),
         Icon(Icons.thumb_up),
      ],
      isSelected: toggleValues,
      onPressed: (index) {
         setState(() {
            toggleValues[index] = !toggleValues[index];
         });
      },
    )
    ```

    In this example, we have created three toggle buttons with different icons. The `isSelected` property is set to the `toggleValues` list, which determines whether each button is selected or not. The `onPressed` callback is used to update the state of the toggle buttons when they are pressed.

4. Handle the state changes in your app:
    ```dart
    void setState(VoidCallback fn) {
      // Update the state of your app here
    }
    ```

    You can define a `setState` function to handle the state changes in your app. This function will be called whenever a toggle button is pressed, allowing you to update the state of your app accordingly.

By following these steps, you can easily implement toggle buttons in your mobile app. Experiment with different icons and styles to customize the look and feel of your toggle buttons.
